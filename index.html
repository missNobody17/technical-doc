        <p>A number of seals seemingly depicting unicorns have been found from the Indus Valley Civilization.[5] Seals with such a design are thought to be a mark of high social rank.[6] These have also been interpreted as representations of aurochs—a type of large wild cattle that formerly inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa—or derivatives of aurochs, because the animal is always shown in profile, indicating there may have been another horn, which is not seen in profile.[7]<br><br>

Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book Indika ("On India") described them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half (700 mm, 28 inches) in length, and colored white, red and black.[8]<br><br>

Unicorn in Apadana, Shush, Iran
Ctesias got his information while living in Persia.Unicorns on a relief sculpture have been found at the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran.[9] Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called "Indian ass" (ἰνδικὸς ὄνος).[10][11] Antigonus of Carystus also wrote about the one-horned "Indian ass".[12] Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like heads.[13] Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a rhinoceros) as one-horned beasts, as well as "a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two cubits [900 mm, 35 inches] in length."[14] In On the Nature of Animals (Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος, De natura animalium), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, adds that India produces also a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52),[15][16] and says (xvi. 20)[17] that the monoceros (Greek: μονόκερως) was sometimes called cartazonos (Greek: καρτάζωνος), which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann, meaning "rhinoceros".

Cosmas Indicopleustes, a merchant of Alexandria who lived in the 6th century, made a voyage to India and subsequently wrote works on cosmography. He gives a description of a unicorn based on four brass figures in the palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from report, that "it is impossible to take this ferocious beast alive; and that all its strength lies in its horn. When it finds itself pursued and in danger of capture, it throws itself from a precipice, and turns so aptly in falling, that it receives all the shock upon the horn, and so escapes safe and sound".</p>
        
        <br><h3 id="myh3">Middle Ages and Renaissance</h3>
       <p> Medieval knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and the creature was variously represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse.
<br><br>
The predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of religious art. Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers,[citation needed] whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.
<br><br>
The unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch's Triumph of Chastity, and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted c. 1472–74), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn by a pair of unicorns.[20]

The unicorn throne in Denmark
The Throne Chair of Denmark is made of "unicorn horns" – almost certainly narwhal tusks. The same material was used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following classical authors.

<br><br>
The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.[21]</p>

        <h3 id="myh3">Biblical</h3>
        <p>
          An animal called the re’em (Hebrew: רְאֵם‎) is mentioned in several places in the Hebrew Bible, often as a metaphor representing strength. The allusions to the re'em as a wild, untamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns[34] best fit the aurochs (Bos primigenius); this view is further supported by the Assyrian cognate word rimu, which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns.[35] This animal was often depicted in ancient Mesopotamian art in profile, with only one horn visible.[citation needed]
<br><br>
The translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible (1611) followed the Greek Septuagint (monokeros) and the Latin Vulgate (unicornis)[36] and employed unicorn to translate re'em, providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its untamable nature. The American Standard Version translates this term "wild ox" in each case.

The classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the Re'em animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the Talmud debate the proposition that the Tahash animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned kosher creature that existed in Moses' time, or that it was similar to the keresh animal described in Morris Jastrow's Talmudic dictionary as "a kind of antelope, unicorn".[37]

<h3 id="myh3">Chinese mythology</h3>
<p>
  <div class="box">

  The qilin (Chinese: 麒麟), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called "the Chinese unicorn", and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a hybrid animal that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (kirin) more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese qilin. The Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated "unicorn" is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of Tây Nguyên. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.[38][39]</div>
<br><br>
Beginning in the Ming Dynasty, the qilin became associated with giraffes, after Zheng He's voyage to East Africa brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in Nanjing as qilin.[40] The resemblance to the qilin was noted in the giraffe's ossicones (bony protrusions from the skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.[41]
<br><br>
Shanhaijing (117) also mentioned Bo-horse (Chinese: 駮馬; pinyin: bómǎ), a chimera horse with ox tail, single horn, white body, and its sound like person calling. The creature is lived at Honest-head Mountain. Guo Pu in his jiangfu said that Bo-horse able to walk on water. Another similar creature also mentioned in Shanhaijing (80) to live in Mount Winding-Centre as Bo (Chinese: 駮; pinyin: bó), but with black tail, tiger's teeth and claws, and also devour leopards and tigers.[42]

            <h3 id="myh3">THE LAST UNICORN</h3>
            <p class="box">
             Neil Gaiman is a fan (“I loved The Last Unicorn…”), George R R Martin is a fan, but are you a fan of Peter S. Beagle’s The Last Unicorn?<br><br>
              First published on March 25th, 1968, the book is about a unicorn named Lady Amalthea who realizes she is the last her kind. Setting out to find her compatriots, Lady Amalthea. Along the way she picks up the sorcerer Schmendrick and the bitter but hopeful Molly Grue.<br><br>

This may seem to be a lighthearted journey, and in many ways it is — after all, it is a young adult child’s book — but within the pages are universal themes that reach beyond the words themselves. The book talks about death, fate, what when to fight and when not to fight, and what doing what needs to be done even if you don’t want to.
              <img  src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nm50PASeL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 25%;margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">
              The novel deals with very adult themes, showing that unicorns can be used to express anything from purity to love to grief and heartache — in fact, unicorns can cover that cover the whole human spectrum of emotions, and that’s amazing considering they are usually just white horses with a horn on their head.<br>

                Although a unicorn never shows up to properly stab Voldemort in his snake-like face, they do encounter each other. Unfortunately it’s in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and Voldemort is on the back of Professor Quirrell. And he’s eating unicorn blood to sustain himself.
                Thanks JK. Why couldn’t a unicorn get revenge on Voldmort by stabbing him? Or at least at one point in the book the unicorn could have gotten in a quarrel in Professor Quirrell.

            <p>
              This book is no joke. In fact, it might save your life. Released on, February 14th, 2017 the information this book provides is so valuable that I can’t believe we’ve survived as a species this long without this crucial knowledge.<br><br>

I’ve dilly-dallied enough. Ame Dyckman teams up with illustrator Liz Climo to create this laugh-out-loud hilarious book, You Don’t Want a Unicorn. It’s a cautionary tale taken to the extreme, asking us the hard hitting questions like: Are unicorns magical delight incarnate or are they a mythological menace?
              <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54c2be22e4b0a736d2ab321f/1488331392619-BGPTJ2JAOWXUN4WKYOG8/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFTEgwhRQcX9r3XtU0e50sUUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcjVvFZn3_1TpSINbj1p15LLAjcj6UHNkQOuDz3gO52lBvccB2t33iJEaqs_Hdgp_g/thumbnail_facebook.png?format=1000w" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
             <br><br>
With images of a unicorn getting its horn stuck in a ceiling after a gentle hop to cupcakes you can’t eat all over the house (don’t ask where they come from), you’ll laugh until you have tears down your face. You might not think about this book right after you put it down, but, like a boomerang, it will come back…
<br><br>
…and at that moment you’ll realize that this story actually has broader themes. From pets to children, this cute cautionary tale gives you the right amount of laughter and the right amount of fear all rolled into one pretty (and disarming) package.

            Let’s get serious now. A war is raging. The Evil White Witch is leading an attack against Aslan and, for the sake of all of Narnia, Aslan needs all the help he can get. Of course Unicorns join this great battle in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.<br><br>
            But when Aslan needs everything to join him in the terrifying climax in The Last Battle against the devil God Tash, and with everyone from Eustace Scrubb to Lucy Pevensie, of course the unicorns are back.<br><br>
“Dear King,” said the Unicorn, “I could almost wish you had, so that I might forgive it. Farewell. We have known great joys together. If Aslan gave me my choice I would choose no other life than the life I have had and no other death than the one we go to.”
Unicorns are an inspiration to us all.

     <p>The first known depiction of a unicorn—found in the Lascaux Caves of modern-day France—dates to around 15,000 BCE! Or so people thought, until they realized that the so-called Lascaux unicorn had two horns, drawn confusingly close together.</p>

    <p>The earliest record of unicorns in Western literature belongs to Greek historian Ctesias. In the 5th century BCE, he wrote that the beast had a white body, purple head, blue eyes, and a multicolored horn—red at the tip, black in the middle, and white at the base.</p>
          </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p> In his travels, Marco Polo believed he stumbled across unicorns. He wrote, “They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe unicorns.” That’s because they were actually rhinoceroses.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>
      Genghis Khan reportedly decided not to conquer India after meeting a unicorn, which bowed down to him; he viewed it as a sign from his dead father and turned his army back.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>During the Dark Ages, when science famously took a back seat to illogical hunches, collections known as bestiaries listed the biological properties and medicinal use of known animals, which at the time included unicorns. It’s in these collections that virgins were first described as having great power over the creatures.</p>
          </li>       
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>The King James version of the Old Testament contains nine references to unicorns, thanks to a mistranslation of the Hebrew word re’em. The original word was likely the Assyrian rimu (auroch), an extinct species of wild ox.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>The legend that unicorn horns could counteract poison and purify water was bad news for narwhal populations, as the single tooth protruding from the front of the whale’s head made for a popular counterfeit. The Danes even had a throne made of narwhal horns</p>
          </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>At its height, “unicorn horn” was literally worth 10 times its weight in gold. In 1560, German merchants sold a unicorn horn for an astronomical 90,000 scudi—then about £18,000—to the pope. Pharmacies in London sold powdered unicorn horn as late as 1741.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p>Early unicorn heraldry can be found on the ancient seals of Babylonia and Assyria, but it’s most famously attached to Scotland’s King James III in the 1400s. Two gold coins of that era were even known as the unicorn and the half-unicorn!</p>

    <p> If you’re looking to hunt a unicorn, but don’t know where to begin, try Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.
